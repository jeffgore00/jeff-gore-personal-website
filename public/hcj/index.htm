  <h1 style="font-size:1.5em">A note from Jeff Gore (the scowling restaurant patron above):</h1>
  <p>Not sure how you made it here...you've discovered my dirty little secret; I maintain a domain name containing the name "Jeffrey." But this is not my homepage, nor will it ever be. My true homepage will eventually be located at <a href="http://jeffgore.info">http://jeffgore.info</a>.</p>
  <p>I found this domain years ago and decided to use it exclusively for testing what I was learning about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in my quest to become a software engineer and developer of web applications.</p>
  <p>I actually enjoy writing documentation of existing code in order to understand concepts more thoroughly, and plan on adapting some of my writing for public consumption. For example, click <a href="https://gist.github.com/jeffgore00/9a99ed5f5687ced89deb615c5c708c83">here</a> for an in-depth look at the CSS background property.</p>
